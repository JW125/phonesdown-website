        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>How does the game detect when I pick up my phone?</h3>
        <p>Check Please uses your phone's motion sensors (accelerometer) to detect when the phone is tilted or picked up. This works even when your phone is locked!</p>

        <h3>Does the app drain my battery?</h3>
        <p>No! We use battery-efficient sensors and minimal background processing. You can play multiple games throughout the day without noticeable battery impact.</p>

        <h3>Can I cheat by turning off my phone?</h3>
        <p>Nice try! If your phone disconnects from the game, you'll be marked as having "checked" your phone. Keep it on and face-down!</p>

        <h3>How do I invite friends to my crew?</h3>
        <p>Go to your Crew tab and tap "Invite". You can share an invite link via text, or give them your crew code to enter manually.</p>

        <h3>What happens if no one picks up their phone?</h3>
        <p>Then everyone wins! You all enjoyed a phone-free meal together. That's the real prize. 🎉</p>
